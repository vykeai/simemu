"""
Exclusive-claim primitives for simemu sessions.

A claim is exclusive when the device's sim_id appears in exactly one non-terminal
session at a time. The session store (`sessions.json`) is already protected by
`fcntl.flock` — this module adds two pieces on top:

1. Liveness tracking: each session records the PID and process-group of the
   claimant. A claim whose owner process is no longer alive is "stale" and
   may be reaped by the next claim attempt.

2. Token-based ownership: each session is issued a `claim_token` (opaque
   secret). Callers that want to enforce strict ownership (sub-agent spawning
   the session, child shells inheriting via env) can validate the token in
   `simemu do` by setting `SIMEMU_SESSION_TOKEN`. Backwards-compatible: when
   the env var is unset the check is skipped (existing CLI callers still work).

This module is deliberately small and side-effect-free. The session module
imports its helpers; tests can call them directly.

def claimant_pid() -> int:
    """Return the PID that should be recorded as the claim owner.

    The simemu CLI is typically a short-lived process: an agent shell invokes
    `simemu claim ios`, the CLI prints the session JSON and exits, and the
    SHELL keeps the session alive across many follow-up `simemu do` calls.
    If we recorded the CLI's own PID (os.getpid()), every claim would look
    "stale" the moment the CLI exited, and a sibling claim attempt would
    reap it — re-freeing the device for double-claim. That is exactly the
    incident this module exists to prevent.

    Resolution order:

    1. ``SIMEMU_CLAIMANT_PID`` — explicit override from a long-lived
       supervisor (e.g. an orchestrator that wants to bind the claim to its
       own PID).
    2. ``os.getppid()`` — the shell / parent process. Survives the CLI exit.
